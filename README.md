# CSS Loading Animation
Pure CSS loading animation. Use it as a class to easily add an elegant loading state to your apps!

## Why did I deploy this as a React app?
It was just easier for me to create a really basic example of toggling loading state. To use the loading animation itself, you do **not** need React. Mostly you'll need a way to dynamically add a CSS class.

## Spinning this up locally
* Install dependencies
```
yarn install
# or
npm install
```
* Run the development server:
```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
